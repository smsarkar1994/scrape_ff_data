# SAY NO TO SUICIDE PUBLIC LICENSE 

We've lost so many genius developers, who committed suicide, 
such as [Aaron Hillel Swartz (November 8, 1986 – January 11, 2013)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz).

As a developer, the community needs you, the world needs you, please keep yourself alive.
